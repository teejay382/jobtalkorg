# JobTalk Video Upload and Playback System Fixes

## Current Issues
- [ ] Bucket not found errors for 'videos' and 'thumbnails' buckets
- [ ] NotSupportedError during video playback
- [ ] Inconsistent upload methods (signed URLs for videos, regular upload for thumbnails)
- [ ] Only file extension validation, no content validation
- [ ] Partial uploads not properly handled with rollback
- [ ] Feed may not auto-refresh after uploads
- [ ] Mobile/desktop video playback optimization needed

## Implementation Plan
1. [ ] Verify and ensure Supabase buckets exist
2. [ ] Fix upload consistency - use signed URLs for both video and thumbnail
3. [ ] Add MP4 content validation
4. [ ] Implement upload rollback on failure
5. [ ] Improve error handling and messages
6. [ ] Ensure feed auto-refreshes after successful uploads
7. [ ] Add mobile/desktop video optimizations
8. [ ] Fix NotSupportedError with format conversion
