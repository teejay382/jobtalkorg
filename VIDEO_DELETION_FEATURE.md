if (!user || video.user.id !== user.id) {
  // Error: Not authorized
  return;
}
```

const isOwnVideo = user && video.user.id === user.id;

{isOwnVideo && (
  // Delete button only renders if true
)}
```

## üêõ **Error Handling**

### **Database Deletion Fails**
- Shows error toast
- Video remains visible
- No storage deletion attempted

### **Storage Deletion Fails**
- Shows warning in console
- Database record still deleted
- Continues with operation
- User still sees success (database is source of truth)

### **URL Parsing Fails**
- Logs warning
- Skips storage deletion for that file
- Database deletion succeeds
- Shows success to user

### **Not Authorized**
- Shows error toast
- No deletion attempted
- Video remains unchanged

---

## üí° **Implementation Details**

### **Why Delete Button in Top-Left?**
- ‚úÖ Mute button already in top-right
- ‚úÖ Left position is less common = less accidental clicks
- ‚úÖ Clear visual separation from other controls
- ‚úÖ Red color stands out against glassmorphism

### **Why Confirmation Dialog?**
- ‚úÖ Prevents accidental deletions
- ‚úÖ Shows video title for confirmation
- ‚úÖ Clearly states action is permanent
- ‚úÖ Standard UX pattern for destructive actions

### **Why Delete Storage Files?**
- ‚úÖ Frees up storage space
- ‚úÖ Prevents orphaned files
- ‚úÖ Keeps storage clean
- ‚úÖ Database is still source of truth

### **Why Refresh After Delete?**
- ‚úÖ Removes deleted video from view immediately
- ‚úÖ Updates video count
- ‚úÖ Ensures feed is in sync with database
- ‚úÖ Better user experience

---

## üöÄ **Future Enhancements**

### **Potential Additions:**

1. **Bulk Delete**
   - Select multiple videos
   - Delete all at once
   - From profile page

2. **Soft Delete**
   - Mark as deleted instead of removing
   - 30-day recovery period
   - Auto-delete after expiry

3. **Delete History**
   - Log deletions
   - Show deleted videos
   - Restore option (if soft delete)

4. **Analytics**
   - Track deletion reasons
   - User feedback on delete
   - Retention metrics

5. **Permissions**
   - Admin can delete any video
   - Moderator approval for deletion
   - Restore deleted videos

---

## üìù **Usage Examples**

### **In Video Feed Component:**
```typescript
<OptimizedVideoCard
  video={video}
  isActive={index === activeVideoIndex}
  onRefresh={fetchVideos} // Required for delete to work
  isVisible={visibleVideos.has(index)}
/>
```

### **In Profile Page:**
```typescript
<AlertDialog>
  <AlertDialogTrigger asChild>
    <button className="delete-button">
      <Trash2 className="w-3 h-3" />
    </button>
  </AlertDialogTrigger>
