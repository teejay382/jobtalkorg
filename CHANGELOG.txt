[2025-01-25] NOTIFICATION SYSTEM + CHAT NAV FIX

Problem:
- Notifications not firing (comments, likes, messages)
- Chat back button not working

Root Cause:
- Migration file created but NEVER APPLIED to database
- No notifications table, triggers, or functions existed
- Chat used only callback, no router integration

Solution:
1. Fixed migration SQL syntax (indexes)
2. Added real-time enablement to notifications table
3. Created notification triggers for comments, likes, messages
4. Fixed chat back button with navigate(-1)
5. Added click-to-navigate for notifications
6. Visual read/unread distinction + mark as read

CRITICAL: Must apply migration first!
  Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run migration file
  File: supabase/migrations/20250125000000_notifications_system.sql

Testing:
- Use NotificationTester component (src/components/debug/)
- Two-account test: comment/like/message triggers notification
- Verify real-time updates (< 1 second)

Files Changed:
- supabase/migrations/20250125000000_notifications_system.sql (database)
- src/hooks/useNotifications.ts (real-time subscription)
